## Description
There are three different codes for three different functions. I.e
1. Grades.js
Prompts the user to enter student marks and then outputs the correct grade:
run using node grades.js on terminal, enter input and it will provide an appropriate grade based on your input

2. Speed.js
Takes as input an appropriate value i.e the speed of a car and gives the correct output.
eg if the speed of the car is a number below seventy it will output "OK", and 
for every 5km above 70 which is the speed limit it adds a demerit point, which
initially starts at zero but after maximising at 12 demerit points it will output
"suspend licence" all the while out puting the number of demerit points

3.salary.js
The netSalary function calculates the net salary of an employee by taking into account their basic salary and benefits. It factors in deductions for taxes, NHIF, and NSSF, providing a comprehensive view of the employee's take-home pay after mandatory contributions and taxes. This function facilitates easy and accurate computation of net salary.
